# Hiring at Scale: Landing A Job With Product Delivery

*This is the second post in a series of articles on hiring at scale.  Be sure to check out earlier posts in our series:*

* [*Hiring at Scale: Interviewing*](http://developer.salesforce.org/#blog/post/2017/06/14/hiring-at-scale-interviewing.html)

So - you've decided that you're ready to apply for a role with [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/) Product Delivery.  Fantastic!  We're looking forward to speaking with you.  Want to make sure that your application stands out?  Here are a few tips that I have for making sure your submission lands on my proverbial desk:

* **Provide a cover letter:** Many of the applications we receive do not have a cover letter.  Having a cover letter helps you stand out amongst the hundreds of other applications we see.  In particular, your cover letter should specify why you are interested in joining such a mission-driven organization as Salesforce.org.  This is your opportunity to stand out amongst the crowd!
* **Check out our code:** Our products are open-source.  Take a look at our application source code well before your interview.  Be curious, ask questions and come prepared with feedback that you can share with the team.  Head on over to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation) to see what we're working on.
* **Be “Remote Ready”:** Our team is fully distributed, and as such, we spend a lot of time on Google Meet.  Ensure that you have a high quality headset and camera for these interviews and have ample network bandwidth to sustain lengthy video conversations.
* **Have fun:** Interviews can be a stressful time for not only candidates, but also new interviewers, as well as hiring managers.  Ultimately interviews can be seen as a good opportunity for both candidates and employers to make sure they are a good fit for a long-term relationship.  Why not have fun while doing it?

The Product Delivery team at [Salesforce.org](http://salesforce.org/) is growing rapidly, and we're looking for engineers to join our mission-driven team.  Interested in learning more?
